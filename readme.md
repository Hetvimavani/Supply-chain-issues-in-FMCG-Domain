# Supply Chain Service Level Analytics (FMCG Domain)

## Overview
## Problem statement
AtliQ Mart is a growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India. It is currently operational in three cities Surat, Ahmedabad and Vadodra. They want to expand to other metro/tier1 cities in the next 2 years.

AtliQ Mart is currently facing a problem where a few key customers did not extend the annual contract due to service issues. It is speculated that some of the essential products were either not delivered on time or not delivered in full over a continued period, which could have resulted in bad customer service. Management wants to fix this issue before expanding to other cities and requested their supply chain analytics team to track the ’On time’ and ‘In Full’ delivery service level for all the customers on a daily basis so that they can respond swiftly to these issues.

The Supply Chain team decided to use a standard approach to measure the service level in which they will measure ‘on-time delivery (OT) %’, ‘In-full delivery (IF) %’ and OnTime in full (OTIF) % of the customer orders on a daily basis against the target service level set for each customer.

## Key Metrics
| KPI | Description |
|-----|--------------|
| OT% | Orders delivered on time |
| IF% | Orders delivered in full |
| OTIF% | Delivered both on time & in full |

## Insights Derived

* **All key performance metrics (OT%, IF%, OTIF%) remain well below their respective targets**, indicating a consistent gap in overall supply chain efficiency.
* On average, **orders are delayed by 0.42 days** from the agreed delivery date, reflecting minor but frequent scheduling inefficiencies.
* **Lotus Mart, Coolblue, and Acclaimed Stores** account for the highest order volumes — yet they also contribute the most to delayed deliveries, highlighting potential process bottlenecks.
* **Possible causes to investigate:**

  * Are we **underestimating delivery timelines** during order planning or customer communication?
  * Are **order volumes exceeding production and logistics capacity**, causing fulfillment delays?
* **Product-wise analysis** shows that **Ghee, Curd, and Butter** categories are most frequently delayed, possibly due to cold-chain or packaging dependencies.
* Across recent months, there has been **no noticeable improvement** in any of the key metrics (OT%, IF%, OTIF%), suggesting a need for focused performance initiatives.
* A **significant gap in IF% (In-Full Delivery)** is observed for multiple customers, which may stem from **limited production output or inaccurate demand forecasting**.
