# Supply Chain Service Level Analytics (FMCG Domain)

## Overview
## Problem statement
This project is based on a FMCG (Fast-Moving Consumer Goods) supply chain scenario involving operations across three major cities in Gujarat — Surat, Ahmedabad, and Vadodara.
The organization is preparing for expansion into additional metro and tier-1 cities over the next two years.

Recently, management observed that some key customers did not renew their annual contracts due to recurring service issues. In particular, several essential products were not delivered on time or not delivered in full, resulting in lower customer satisfaction and potential revenue loss.

To address these challenges, the Supply Chain Analytics team was tasked with designing a Service Level Performance Dashboard to monitor delivery performance metrics daily.
The goal is to quickly identify and correct service issues before they impact customer retention or future expansion.

## Key Metrics
| KPI | Description |
|-----|--------------|
| OT% | Orders delivered on time |
| IF% | Orders delivered in full |
| OTIF% | Delivered both on time & in full |

## Insights Derived

* **All key performance metrics (OT%, IF%, OTIF%) remain well below their respective targets**, indicating a consistent gap in overall supply chain efficiency.
* On average, **orders are delayed by 0.42 days** from the agreed delivery date, reflecting minor but frequent scheduling inefficiencies.
* **Lotus Mart, Coolblue, and Acclaimed Stores** account for the highest order volumes — yet they also contribute the most to delayed deliveries, highlighting potential process bottlenecks.
* **Possible causes to investigate:**

  * Are we **underestimating delivery timelines** during order planning or customer communication?
  * Are **order volumes exceeding production and logistics capacity**, causing fulfillment delays?
* **Product-wise analysis** shows that **Ghee, Curd, and Butter** categories are most frequently delayed, possibly due to cold-chain or packaging dependencies.
* Across recent months, there has been **no noticeable improvement** in any of the key metrics (OT%, IF%, OTIF%), suggesting a need for focused performance initiatives.
* A **significant gap in IF% (In-Full Delivery)** is observed for multiple customers, which may stem from **limited production output or inaccurate demand forecasting**.
